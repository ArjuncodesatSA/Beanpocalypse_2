Bean Warfare: A First-Person Shooter
Introduction
Bean Warfare is a first-person shooter (FPS) game where you, as a bean, have crash-landed on Earth and must escape from a laboratory. While your fellow beans plan to destroy the nearby town in retaliation for their mistreatment in the lab, 
you choose a different path: to stop them. Your mission is to explore the world, find the parts needed to rebuild a helicopter, and defeat the enemy beans scattered throughout.

Guns & Combat: Engage in combat with enemy beans using a variety of guns.
Exploration: Explore fully-interior houses and a vast, interactive world.
Grappling Mechanic: Use a grappling hook to traverse the environment.
Lab Exploration: Navigate through a detailed laboratory interior.
